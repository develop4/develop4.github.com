			The idea behind the D4 web site was to produce a site that was easy to build and
			maintain while still providing an good looking interface across multiple devices.  
			Using existing resources and developer tools was a high priority as web site
			maintenance and design has a high enough overhead without the additional burden of learning
			new tools, and setting up new environments, diverting resources from core development tasks. 
			</p>
			
			<p>With those restrictions in mind we decided to use the
			the Jekyll templating engine to produce a static website, this allowed
			a flexability in designing the templates for generating the site, while still allowing the creation of
			additional content with the minimum of effort.   The other advantage of using the Jekyll engine
			is that Github provides this as part of its service, allowing site content to be managed via
			source control (git) to and have the site automatically regenerated on every commit.</p>
			<p>The development/deployment process is fairly simple.  Additional pages or modifications are added
			to the local developer copy of the site that has been checked out from Github.  The changes
			are immediatly visible in the local Jekyll server run on the developers environment. As soon as the
			changes have been tested and verified, they are pushed to the Github site.  This allows developers
			to use their standard development environment for creating new content and templates, and using Github
			for storing the source code allows "kills two birds with one stone"; the site source code is securely stored
			and the web site is automatically generated of the Github servers and published.</p>

				Security extensions project to allow the encryption of settings in the Tomcat 7 configuration files.

				This new digester allows the separation of Application Credentials and other sensitive information 
				from the main tomcat configuration files.   The digester configuration, application credentials and 
				passphrases can all be stored in separate areas under heightened security control.   The plug-able 
				decryption modules allow for different decryption methods to be employed. The cyphertext is passed 
				to the appropriate module for decryption based on the namespace prefix of the cyphertext. Each Decoder 
				Module is associated with a namespace prefix, this namespace prefix is returned from the "getNamespace()" 
				method on the Module.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Decoders default behavior should allow them to work without additional configuration. If the 
				Decoder does require additional configuration then parameters can be passed from the decoder.properties file.
			</p>
			<p>
				At tomcat server startup the decryption modules are initialized. Then as tomcat reads the server 
				configuration files the custom digester will decrypt the properties and perform variable substitution 
				of the matched values.
