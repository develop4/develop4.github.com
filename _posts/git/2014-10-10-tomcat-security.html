Security extensions project to allow the encryption of settings in the Tomcat 7 configuration files.  
</p>
<p>
This new digester allows the separation of Application Credentials and other sensitive information 
from the main tomcat configuration files.   The digester configuration, application credentials and 
passphrases can all be stored in separate areas under heightened security control.   The plug-able 
decryption modules allow for different decryption methods to be employed. The cyphertext is passed 
to the appropriate module for decryption based on the namespace prefix of the cyphertext. Each Decoder 
Module is associated with a namespace prefix, this namespace prefix is returned from the "getNamespace()" 
method on the Module.
</p>
<p>
The Decoders default behavior should allow them to work without additional configuration. If the 
Decoder does require additional configuration then parameters can be passed from the decoder.properties file.
</p>
<p>
At tomcat server startup the decryption modules are initialized. Then as tomcat reads the server 
configuration files the custom digester will decrypt the properties and perform variable substitution 
of the matched values.
