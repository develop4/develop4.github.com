	I have one <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> invite left, if
	anyone out there is interested - it is turning into an awesome
	application that I think will really change how open source development
	is done.<br /><!--more-->  Send me an email at bobs [at] gmail.com if you're
	interested.

<p>
	<b>Update:</b> I gave out the original one, but I have 5 more, so let
	me know if you want one again.

<p>
	<b>Another Update:</b> All out again - sorry everyone!
