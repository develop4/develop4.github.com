	Security extensions project to allow the encryption of settings in the Tomcat 7 configuration files.

	This new digester allows the separation of Application Credentials and other sensitive information 
	from the main tomcat configuration files.   The digester configuration, application credentials and 
	passphrases can all be stored in separate areas under heightened security control.   The plug-able 
	decryption modules allow for different decryption methods to be employed. The cyphertext is passed 
	to the appropriate module for decryption based on the namespace prefix of the cyphertext. Each Decoder 
	Module is associated with a namespace prefix, this namespace prefix is returned from the "getNamespace()" 
	method on the Module.
</p>

<p class="mb2 px1">
	The Decoders default behavior should allow them to work without additional configuration. If the 
	Decoder does require additional configuration then parameters can be passed from the decoder.properties file.
</p>

<p class="mb2 px1">
	At tomcat server startup the decryption modules are initialized. Then as tomcat reads the server 
	configuration files the custom digester will decrypt the properties and perform variable substitution 
	of the matched values.
