<p>
	Updating Jekyll to use <a href="http://bundler.io/">bundler</a> was a
	bit more complex than anticipated.
</p>
<p>The first item on the agenda was to make sure that my Ruby
	environment and all the Gems were upto date.
<ul>
	<li><code>gem update --system</code></li>
	<li><code>gem install rails</code></li>
	<li><code>gem update</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The next task was to create the Gemfile required by the bundler.

<pre style="font-size: 12px; background-color: #dddddd;">
source "https://rubygems.org"
#     bundle exec jekyll serve
# This is the default theme for new Jekyll sites. You may change this to anything you like.
gem "minima", "~> 2.0"
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
end
gem 'tzinfo-data', platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]
		</pre>
</ul>

</p>
