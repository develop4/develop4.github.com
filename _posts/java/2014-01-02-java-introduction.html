<p>I have one <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> invite left, if anyone out there is interested - it is turning into an awesome application that I think will really change how open source development is done.<br/>
Send me an email at schacon [at] gmail.com if you're interested.</p><!--more--> 
<p><b>Update:</b> I gave out the original one, but I have 5 more, so let me know if you want one again.</p>
<p><b>Another Update:</b> All out again - sorry everyone!</p>
